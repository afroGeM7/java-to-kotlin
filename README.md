# java-to-kotlin
## For GADS 2021
Updated starter code for the demo project for the **Switch to Kotlin from Java for Android Development** course on PluralSight.
The code is updated from android SDK 26 to android SDK 30 and androidx. The code state is as per the lesson 1 (**Initial Project Setup**) of the **Setting up Your Kotlin Environment** module. https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=81d54a08-e76f-48eb-b40e-a49adf276f06 

This is for those who have failed to update the original demo project source code and have it build successfully.
